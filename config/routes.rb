  # This show route can be refactored into the above resouces' method call above, like so:
  # resources :students, only: [:index, :show]
  # However for the sake of this lab and seeing
  # how you can pass params through the
  # route, we'll keep it explicit and refactor it later
  resources :students, only: :show #, as:'student'
  # get "students/:id", to: "students#show"
  get 'students/:id/activate', to: 'students#activate', as:'activate-student'
